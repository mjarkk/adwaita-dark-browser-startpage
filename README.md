## There is no icon in the search button!
* Download Font Awesome version 5.8.1 (Other versions will most likely also work just fine) and drop it in the Adwaita-Dark-Startpage folder.
* If the Font-awesome folder isn't called fontawesome-free-5.8.1-web either rename it or change the file path in index.html on line 7.
### Alternatively
Replace line 7 in index.html with `<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.8.1/css/all.css" integrity="sha384-50oBUHEmvpQ+1lW4y57PTFmhCaXp0ML5d60M1M7uH2+nqUivzIebhndOJK28anvf" crossorigin="anonymous">`. This however can cause significantly longer load times and you will be relying on a third party for the proper functioning of the start page.
