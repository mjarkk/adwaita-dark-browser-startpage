## There is no icon in the search button!
* Download Font Awesome version 5.8.1 (Other versions will most likely also work just fine) and drop it in the Adwaita-Dark-Startpage folder.
* If the Font-awesome folder isn't called fontawesome-free-5.8.1-web either rename it or change the file path pointing to index.html on line 7.
### Alternatively
Replace line 7 in index.html with `<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.8.1/css/all.css" integrity="sha384-50oBUHEmvpQ+1lW4y57PTFmhCaXp0ML5d60M1M7uH2+nqUivzIebhndOJK28anvf" crossorigin="anonymous">`. This however can cause significantly longer load times and you will be relying on a third party for the proper functioning of the start page.

## I am a noob! How to use!
1. Download Adwaita Dark Homepage.
2. Put it somewhere on your computer where you can't accidentally delete it.
3. Do as suggested above to get Font Awesome installed.
4. Open your favorite browser be it Chrome, Chromium, Firefox, Vivaldi etc..
5. Find the setting in your browser which defines the start page. In Firefox this will be under `Preferences > Home`.
6. Point it to the index.html included in this download.
